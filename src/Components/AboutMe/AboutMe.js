            <p className='mx-4 pb-5 mb-5'> I am currently completing my undergraduate studies in Computer Science.
                Few months back I was really interested to learn web development and in that process I came across  Programming
                Hero's web development course which really helped me understand the concepts well with necessary
                guidance. Now even though I don't have the proper knowledge about everything that goes into the web, yet I feel
                confident enough to explore more as I go deep into the process.
                From here my goal is to sharpen my skills even more and try to help as many people as I can
                with my acquired knowledge. Also looking forward to build exciting stuffs through the opportunities I get in my way.
